# Parinfer for Sublime Text [WORK IN PROGRESS]

A [Parinfer] package for [Sublime Text].

## Status

Nothing works right now; this project is just getting started :)

I am working on the following steps:

* [x] Connect to the Sublime Text API when the text buffer is modified
* [ ] Start a long-running node.js process from Python
* [ ] Bi-directional communication between Python and the node.js process
